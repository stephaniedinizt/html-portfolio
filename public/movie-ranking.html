<h3>Harry Potter and The prisioner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>From all the HP movies, this is my favorite because of the story and how the characters really grew up.</p>

<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>Simply my favorite romance movie.</p>

<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>Was the first fiction book I ever read and of course to see a story from a book that I loved come to life, it was amazing.</p>
