<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Stephanie Tavares and I have my initial career set in the finance area for over 5 years.
  But now I am trying to expand my knowledge and decided to learn a little bit more about coding and programming in order
  to try and have better career opportunities.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, I enrolled in a course from Udemy for Web Development and its teached by
  Angela, one of the best teachers in the area of IT. I am starting from the basics of coding and working
my way up to more complex codes and design.</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of this course, to be able to create my own websites,
  to land a job as a webdeveloper and also to maybe create my own business as a designer to whoever
  might be interested in it.</p>
